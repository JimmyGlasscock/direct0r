# Direct0r
Neural Network designed to take in movie/tv show scripts and create new ones after being trained.

I plan to create a webpage frontend where users can upload their own files and train their own network instances.

### Requirements
- Python 3.7.X
- TensorFlow

### Setup
``` 
pip install tensorflow
pip install matplotlib

git clone https://github.com/jimmyglasscock/direct0r
```
